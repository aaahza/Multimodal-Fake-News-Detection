# Multimodal Fake News Detection System

This repository contains a machine learning system for detecting fake news using a multimodal approach that combines text analysis, image processing, and ensemble methods.

## Overview

The system analyzes three key aspects of news articles:
1. Text content (titles and comments)
2. Image features using Error Level Analysis (ELA)
3. Metadata and engagement metrics

The final prediction is made using an ensemble model that combines these different modalities.

## Project Structure

- 

textData.ipynb

: Text analysis pipeline
- 

imageData.ipynb

: Image analysis pipeline  
- 

ensemble.ipynb

: Final ensemble model

### Text Analysis (`textData.ipynb`)
- TF-IDF vectorization of text content
- Feature extraction from titles and comments
- Text classification models evaluation
- Output: Text-based probability predictions

### Image Analysis (`imageData.ipynb`) 
- Error Level Analysis (ELA) for detecting image manipulation
- Statistical feature extraction:
  - Mean pixel intensity
  - Standard deviation
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Entropy
  - GLCM texture features
  - Edge features
  - Frequency domain features
- Output: Image-based probability predictions

### Ensemble Model (`ensemble.ipynb`)
- Combines features from:
  - Text probabilities
  - Image features
  - Metadata (timestamp, engagement metrics)
- Model evaluation and feature importance analysis
- Final prediction output

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaahza/Multimodal-Fake-News-Detection.git
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Data Preparation:

finalImages

 directory
   - Prepare text data in TSV format with required columns
   - Update file paths in notebooks if needed

2. Run Notebooks in Order:
   ```python
   # 1. Process text data
   jupyter notebook textData.ipynb
   
   # 2. Process images
   jupyter notebook imageData.ipynb
   
   # 3. Run ensemble model
   jupyter notebook ensemble.ipynb
   ```

## Performance Metrics

The system achieves the following performance:
- Text Model Accuracy: ~83.48%
- Image Model Accuracy: ~73.14%
